### _About_

Howdy there - I'm Jordan. I develop, design, compose, teach, and learn from my home in Portland, Oregon.   

Prior to venturing into the world of web development, I taught video game audio, modular synthesis, programming Arduino for microelectronics, CNC laser cutting, and 3D printing at Portland Community College.
