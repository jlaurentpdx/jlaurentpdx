### Howdy.

My name is Jordan, and I am a Full Stack Web Developer and Software Engineer. Prior to venturing into the world of web development, I taught game audio, modular synthesis, programming for microelectronics, laser cutting, and 3D printing at Portland Community College here in Portland, Oregon. I am dedicated to making the web a more open, inclusive, and accessible tool for students, teachers, and lifelong learners.
